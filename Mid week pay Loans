borrowers see a $35 fee for a $300, three-month loan as fair, but 3 in 4 believe it is unfair to charge the same amount for a checking account overdraft. Current regulation does not support borrower preferences because it permits such overdraft fees but does not enable banks to offer lower-cost small-dollar loans at scale.
